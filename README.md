# CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project is creating a functioning code to have a microcontroller function as a thermostat. The thermostat must read and display room temperature, handle interrupts when buttons are pressed to adjust a reading and light up when above the set point and turn off when below the setpoint. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I handled all the requirements well and no issues once I was able to break each function down into segments. 

Where could you improve?

I can work harder at understanding how the timing works and different outputs of bitwise operators. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The Texas Instruments manuals for the CC3220S microcontroller. This was helpful in understanding how the controller worked but can open up possibilities for future projects. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Problem solving but also research skills for looking into other microcontrollers. Being able to make a recommendation to help a team decide which is the best equipment for the task at hand is certainly helpful to add to the toolbelt. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The code follows best practices and comments are made where applicable for ease of understanding.
